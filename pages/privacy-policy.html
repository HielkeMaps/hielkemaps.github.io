WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</strong></h2><strong>In Short: </strong>We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.
<p><strong>If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</strong></p>
<p>The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and UK GDPR require us to explain the valid legal bases we rely on in order to process your personal information. As such, we may rely on the following legal bases to process your personal information:</p>

Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or applications.

<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>
<h2 id="privacyrights"><strong>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</strong></h2><strong>In Short:</strong> Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
<p>In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "<a href="#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>" below.</p>
<p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm">Member State data protection authority</a> or <a href="https://ico.org.uk/make-a-complaint/data-protection-complaints/data-protection-complaints/">UK data protection authority</a>.</p>
<p>If you are located in Switzerland, you may contact the <a href="https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html">Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner</a>.</p>

<h2 id="DNT"><strong>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong></h2>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
<p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time.</p>
